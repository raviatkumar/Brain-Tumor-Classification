# Brain Tumor Classification

## Problem Description

Tumors can be categorized into cancerous (malignant) and non-cancerous (benign) types, with primary tumors originating within the brain and secondary tumors spreading from other parts of the body. The symptoms vary based on the affected brain region and may include persistent headaches, seizures, vision problems, vomiting, and changes in mental function. Notably, morning headaches that alleviate with vomiting are characteristic. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience difficulties in walking, speaking, or sensation, leading to potential unconsciousness.

## More Information About Brain Tumor:

A brain tumor refers to the abnormal growth of cancerous or non-cancerous cells within the brain. Tumors can either originate in the brain or result from cancer spreading from other body parts. Symptoms encompass new or intensified headaches, blurred vision, loss of balance, confusion, and seizures. Some cases may present with no noticeable symptoms. Treatment options involve surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.

## Prevalence:
Brain tumors are relatively rare compared to other types of cancers, accounting for about 1-2% of all cancer diagnoses.

The prevalence can vary by age, with certain types of brain tumors more common in children and others more prevalent in adults.

## Global Incidence:
The incidence of brain tumors varies globally, with differences in rates among countries and populations.

It is estimated that there are around 8 to 10 cases of primary brain tumors per 100,000 people annually.

## Common Causes:

The exact causes of most brain tumors are still not well understood. Some risk factors and associations have been identified, but in many cases, the cause remains unknown.

Known risk factors may include exposure to ionizing radiation, certain genetic conditions, family history, and certain environmental factors.

## Symptoms:

Headache: Acute or persistent

Muscular: Difficulty walking, instability, muscle weakness, coordination problems, weakness on one side of the body, or weakness in the arms and legs

Whole body: Dizziness, fatigue, or vertigo

Gastrointestinal: Nausea or vomiting

Sensory: Pins and needles or reduced sensation of touch

Cognitive: Inability to speak or understand language, mental confusion

Other common symptoms: Blurred vision, difficulty speaking, personality changes, seizures, or sleepiness

Diagnosis and Treatment:
Diagnosis often involves imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans, and sometimes a biopsy may be needed for further characterization.

Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The choice of treatment depends on factors such as the type and grade of the tumor, its location, and the overall health of the patient.
